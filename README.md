#Projects in Space#

A space themed project management application. The use case is: a project manager wants to know at a glance how far a project is from being complete, then be able to drill down into that project to see which tasks are done and which are yet to be completed. Projects can also be added, and tasks added to projects. Overall progress is shown per project. This is a skeleton, proof-of-concept, but can easily be extended.

An API can be built on top, and hooked into any application that can reach it. This vastly improves its application in the real world.

To infinity!
